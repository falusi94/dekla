This is the solution repo for a university course (BMEVISZA403) for declarative programming. I've just found this repo cleaning my stuff and I thought it could be interesting for others. Some parts of the documentation is missing and also the final solutions, if I find I'll upload them. The docs are also in Hungarian, I won't translate them, but the main goal was to decide if the input is a proper sudoku solution or not. The tasks were incremental, so the final solution could be easily created from the current code.
